</p><h3 id="polarion_wiki macro name=module-workitem;params=id=SCRUM--595"></h3><p id="polarion_4">
  <span style="font-style: italic;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;">&lt;Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.&gt;</span>
</p><h3 id="polarion_wiki macro name=module-workitem;params=id=SCRUM--596"></h3><p id="polarion_5">
  <span style="font-style: italic;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;">&lt;List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.&gt;</span>

  <span style="font-style: italic;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;">&lt;Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.&gt;</span>
</p><h3 id="polarion_wiki macro name=module-workitem;params=id=SCRUM--599"></h3><p id="polarion_7">
  <span style="font-style: italic;font-size: 11pt;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;line-height: 1.5;">&lt;Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.&gt;</span>
